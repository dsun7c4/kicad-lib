# kicad-lib

Library of parts used in the kicad design repositories.
Some are modified versions of the standard kicad library and others
are newly created.  The earlier models and footprints were done with
KiCad 4.x and FreeCAD 0.15.

Current version of the models and footprints have been moved to
KiCad 8.x and FreeCAD 1.0.
